title: "My first live stream on Twitch"
---

I did my first live stream on Twitch! This is something I’ve had in mind for such a long time. But then I’d think how I needed to make everything perfect, have a perfect camera, a perfect setup, some perfect content and… Oh, screw it, *I’ll do it live*.

So here it is, my first ever live stream on Twitch with a challenge: *Can I make a 500 KB HTML email smaller in just one hour?* I guess there’s only one way for you to find out! The hour and a half long full stream is [available on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1292448801) for sixty days.

I also made [a shorter recap version for Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxlRDKsvdPo).

This is far, far from perfect. I was nervous (and I switch back to french when I’m nervous). I was stressed. But everyone in the chat was so nice and indulgent. This was a wonderful first experience and I can’t wait to do this again.
