        <h1>Email Developer</h1>
    </div>
    <p>
        I coded my first email in 2006. And in 2008, I co-founded my own web development agency in France: <a href="https://www.tilt-studio.fr">Tilt Studio</a>.

        Here are a few examples of emails I worked on.

            <h3>Bulletin</h3>
            <p>
                I coded the template for the french news media <a href="https://bulletin.fr/">Bulletin.fr</a>. Including an interactive quiz that even works in webmails like Yahoo! Mail or Outlook.com. Thought out and tested as dark mode ready. Got <a href="https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/-welcome-to-bulletin">featured on Really Good Emails</a>.

        <div>
            <h3>Opquast</h3>
            <p>
                I designed and coded the template for the monthly newsletter of <a href="https://www.opquast.com/en/">Opquast</a>, the Web Quality and UX checklist. Minimalist, text-based design, and features a complete dark mode support.
